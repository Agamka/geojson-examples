# Map APIs and GeoJSON
To run the examples on your local machine:

- clone this repository
- put your Google Maps API key in [docroot/index.html](./docroot/index.html)
- put the content of [docroot](./docroot) in the root folder of a local HTTP server

The last step is much easier with Docker. Just run

```
$ docker-compose up
```
and access the map at

```
http://localhost:8080
```
